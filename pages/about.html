                            Token2, any hardware token sold by Token2 can be backed by TOTPRadius as the authentication
                            service. Newer versions of TOTPRadius allow organizing access to corporate VPN using FIDO
                            Security keys (legacy U2F or FIDO2) both via 2FA and Passwordless method. TOTPRadius is free
                            for 5 users and more licenses can be purchased online if needed.
                            Token2 TOTPRadius provides the RADIUS RFC-2865 for TOTP RFC-6238 based authentication. With
                            TOTPRadius you can integrate a large variety of third-party products and systems with
                            multi-factor authentication. A number of enterprise products and services like VPNs
                            (including Meraki CVPN and Fortinet VPN), Citrix XenApp/XenDesktop, VMWare View, and many

                            authentications.
                            TOTPRadius features many innovative approaches to multifactor authentication, such as
                            self-service enrollment and FIDO security keys-based L2TP VPN access using VPN Portal. To
                            ensure the security of the VPN Portal is at the highest level, we have contracted an
                            independent security company, SySS GmbH , which has conducted the penetration testing and
                            produced a security certificate available below. The TOTPRadius VPN Portal component is
                            currently labeled as "Certified Website - Approved Security" by SySS Gmbh.
